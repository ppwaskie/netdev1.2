\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Namespaces and containers seem to be the rage today, but itâ€™s not typical for large applications to use them directly. Rather, applications rely on frameworks such as LXC and/or Docker to manage the containers they run in.

This paper will focus on how a large application can utilize the network namespace framework, and how it can use large numbers of namespaces to partition up the underlying network infrastructure within the application. An overview of parts of the application architecture using the namespaces will be covered, showing the use cases driving the need for namespaces. Lessons learned around scalability and performance bottlenecks in the kernel will be shared.

Ultimately this paper will propose further improvements to the namespace framework for better programmatic management of namespaces within the kernel from userspace, as well as attention to increased scalability and efficiency of networking within the namespaces.

\section{Introduction}
The ongoing evolution of the datacenter towards cloud-based infrastructure continues to present interesting challenges to existing applications. These existing solutions, e.g. storage appliances, work to serve multiple tenants within a computing domain. However, when the infrastructure around these solutions evolves into a cloud-based, partitioned environment, these solutions must also evolve.

When an application has core logic that needs to span multiple, separate network environments, it must become container/network-namespace aware. The Linux kernel exposes an API to create and manage network namespaces within an application. This paper will focus on this API for the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item How to create and manage the lifecycle of a network namespace within a complex application
\item How to track and process multiple network connections across multiple network namespaces in an efficient and scalable manner
\item What limitations exist in this API that makes lifecycle management a challenge, along with proposals on how to improve the API for better lifecycle management
\item Scalability issues encountered, how these were addressed, and proposals around scalability testing to prevent regressions
\end{itemize}
